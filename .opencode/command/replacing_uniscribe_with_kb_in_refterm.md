# Initial setup and analysis phase

# CRITICAL: Create and maintain a comprehensive todolist throughout!

Use researcher agent to analyze all three codebases and create initial todolist:

1. Research uniscribe usage patterns in $UNISCRIBE_SOURCE
2. Research kb capabilities and API in $KB_LIBRARY
3. Research current replacement progress in $REFTERM_KB_DEST
4. MANDATORY: Create detailed todolist with TodoWrite tool following the 6-step pattern
   - The todolist is your PRIMARY tracking mechanism
   - Keep it updated CONSTANTLY throughout the replacement process
   - Track which uniscribe features have been replaced and which remain

# Execute the replacement process with 6-step cycles

# Each cycle handles one specific uniscribe→kb replacement task

For each replacement task, follow this 6-step sequence:

Step 1 - Research Uniscribe Implementation:
Use researcher to understand uniscribe usage in refterm-uniscribe

- Mark current research task as in_progress in todolist
- Analyze specific uniscribe API calls and features
- Understand text shaping/rendering pipeline
- Identify font handling and glyph processing
- Document complex script support requirements
- Note performance characteristics and optimizations
- Update todolist with specific uniscribe features found

Step 2 - Research KB Equivalent Functionality:
Use researcher to find kb's approach to the same problem

- Continue tracking in todolist
- Study kb's text rendering architecture in $KB_LIBRARY
- Map uniscribe features to kb equivalents
- Understand kb's API for similar operations
- Identify any gaps or different approaches
- Note kb's performance characteristics
- Document how kb handles what uniscribe was doing
- Update todolist with kb implementation approach

Step 3 - Research Current Replacement State:
Use researcher to check progress in refterm-kb

- Examine what's already been replaced in $REFTERM_KB_DEST
- Identify partial implementations or TODOs
- Check for any temporary shims or compatibility layers
- Understand integration patterns already established
- Find where this specific replacement should go
- Note any existing helper functions or utilities
- THIS IS CRITICAL: maintain consistency with existing replacements

Step 4 - Execute Replacement:
Use executioner to implement the uniscribe→kb replacement

- Mark execution task as in_progress in todolist
- Remove uniscribe-specific code systematically
- Implement kb equivalent following established patterns
- Ensure proper memory management (kb may use different allocation)
- Handle edge cases that differ between uniscribe and kb
- Maintain performance parity or improvement
- Mark completed replacement as done IMMEDIATELY

Step 5 - Research Replacement Quality:
Use researcher to verify the replacement is complete and correct

- Compare functionality between old uniscribe and new kb implementation
- Verify all text rendering cases still work
- Check performance characteristics
- Ensure no uniscribe dependencies remain
- Validate kb patterns are used correctly
- Identify any regressions or missing features
- Test complex scripts and edge cases if applicable

Step 6 - Adjust Todos & Commit:
MANDATORY: Full todolist update and commit cycle

- Commit current replacement with descriptive message (e.g., "Replace uniscribe ScriptShape with kb text shaping")
- Mark ALL completed replacements as done in todolist
- Add tasks for any issues discovered in Step 5
- Add follow-up tasks for related uniscribe removals
- Remove obsolete tasks that are no longer needed
- Ensure todolist tracks remaining uniscribe dependencies
- Maintain the 6-step pattern for remaining replacements
- Continue cycle if more replacements needed
- NEVER skip this todolist update - it's CRITICAL for tracking

# Example todolist structure for uniscribe→kb replacement:

1. Research: Analyze uniscribe's ScriptItemize usage in refterm-uniscribe
2. Research: Study kb's text segmentation approach
3. Research: Check ScriptItemize replacement status in refterm-kb
4. Execute: Replace ScriptItemize with kb segmentation
5. Research: Verify segmentation replacement quality
6. Adjust & Commit: Update todos and commit segmentation replacement
7. Research: Analyze uniscribe's ScriptShape glyph generation
8. Research: Study kb's glyph shaping system
9. Research: Check current glyph shaping in refterm-kb
10. Execute: Replace ScriptShape with kb glyph shaping
11. Research: Verify glyph shaping quality and correctness
12. Adjust & Commit: Update todos and commit glyph shaping
    ...continue 6-step pattern...

# Special considerations for uniscribe→kb replacement:

- Uniscribe is Windows-specific, kb is cross-platform
- Memory allocation patterns differ significantly
- Performance characteristics may vary
- Complex script support needs careful testing
- Font handling approaches are fundamentally different
- Some uniscribe features may not have direct kb equivalents

# Quality assurance and final commit

Final research step to validate the complete replacement:

- Verify ALL uniscribe dependencies are removed
- Check that all text rendering features work with kb
- Ensure no Windows-specific code remains (unless intentional)
- Validate performance meets or exceeds uniscribe version
- Test with various fonts and scripts
- Make final commit summarizing the complete uniscribe→kb replacement

Think carefully at each step! The goal is systematic replacement of uniscribe with kb while maintaining all functionality!

REMEMBER: The todolist is your primary tool for success - keep it updated CONSTANTLY throughout all 6 steps!
REMEMBER: This is a REPLACEMENT, not a port - uniscribe code must be removed, not adapted!
REMEMBER: Always research all three codebases before making changes!
